Jay, a graduate of The University of Leeds, has a professional background as a Managing Director in an ISO systems accredited company and has also worked as an international business and quality systems consultant related to crisis management events.

This extensive experience coupled with an MBA in International Strategic Leadership gives him the credentials to review systems quickly and effectively and apply a continual improvement philosophy to any business system. He believes this is the way competitive advantages are built and maintained. 

In his spare time Jay continues his life-long study of martial arts and is currently training to be a certified life/executive coach. He enjoys travelling with Canada being his favourite destination.
