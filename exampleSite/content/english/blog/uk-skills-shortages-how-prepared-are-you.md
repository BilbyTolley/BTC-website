title = "UK skills shortages - How prepared are you?"

+++
It has been widely reported that the UK is currently suffering from a skills shortage (Financial Times 6/9/21, BBC 3/6/21, CBI 29/6/21). It is possible that this shortage could last for up to five years if action isnâ€™t taken either by Government or firms.

This is of major concern for all businesses and indeed the economy but could have a more pronounced effect on small businesses as they look to propel themselves into the new normal following the pandemic.

There are several ways a business could protect themselves from this skills shortage:

1) Make sure the employees they have are happy

2) Pay more for the skilled and hope that they are attracted to what you are offering

A third way that businesses could address this skills shortage is to look into making their organisational processes more efficient and/or more automated. This would then lead to less hands-on time, less training, less HR, less recruitment drives and over time a better bottom line.

If the shortage continues it is likely that efficiency and automation drives, especially within manufacturing, will become a necessity and may expedite the incoming technologies of Industry 4.0 (see Rick's blog of 13/9/21). With this being the case, how ready are you for a skills shortage in your industry and how will you attract the best talent from the already near full employment market? In short how attractive is your business to the best talent out there?

Instead of spending money inflating salaries, which is not a proven way to keep employees committed to your business, it may make sense to review your organisational culture and environment, perhaps your training structure could be upgraded to help fill any skills gaps, or you could inspire employees by articulating an exciting strategic vision for the future.

It is imperative that small businesses are prepared for a long haul with regard to the labour and skills shortage and a strategy should be in place to ensure that your business stands out from the crowd not only with a competitive business slant but also offering challenging career opportunities to attract the best talent.
