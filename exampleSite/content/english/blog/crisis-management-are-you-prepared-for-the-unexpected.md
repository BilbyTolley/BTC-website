What is a crisis? We’ve all dealt with one or more at some point in our lives but we tend to deal with them off the cuff, relying on experience and education to make the best decisions we can in the moment.

The Oxford Dictionary defines a crisis as being:

‘A time of intense difficulty or danger’

with an origin from late middle English related to the turning point of a disease…

Business related crises, in the main, tend to be less dramatic than ‘life or death’ situations but nevertheless put incredible stress on people, systems and the business as a whole, possibly endangering the brand’s reputation in the market.

How a business mitigates against potential crises can set it apart from the pack and potentially leave it in a more competitive, lean, and agile position if the crisis is managed and controlled effectively.

How can this be achieved?

The first hurdle is acknowledging that your business will at some point be faced with a crisis of some magnitude, low, mid or high level and that you need to have a plan in place, this seems obvious, but many firms do not see crisis management as a priority until it’s too late.

From there it is important to assemble a crisis management team. This must include representation from across the organisation so that not only all operational areas are covered but also so that any decisions are ‘bounced’ off other areas of the business that could be affected. It is crucial to have a high-level decision maker, as leader of this team, as well as a communication facilitator to control information flow both within the organisation and outside to customers, media etc. They also cancel out any ‘noise’ before it reaches the decision maker.

Once the team is assembled, it’s a good idea to run through some training scenarios and to make sure you are able to hit the ground running in the event of a real crisis. It’s also a very sensible idea to consider media training for the communication facilitator to help them effectively manage any associated negative publicity. Larger companies may have a full-time dedicated PR/communications manager.

Quickly assembling the team and the way they deal with crises may determine, in a worst-case scenario, the survival of the business. Therefore, a crisis management policy is a must-have for businesses of any size. Bilby Tolley & Company have the necessary expertise and experience to develop your crisis management plan and provide the required training and development to your team. It really is a case of being proactive rather than reactive to potential crises, and ensuring that your organisation has the resilience to withstand unexpected shocks.
