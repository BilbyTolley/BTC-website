Your operational functions are free flowing and customer expectations are being met on an ongoing basis. In the back of your operational manager’s prepared-for-anything mind, your Spidey sense is tingling, you know that all your competitors are doing and achieving the same. How can you do things better to increase your market share?

All businesses rely on their suppliers to meet raw material requirements either well before, before or just in time. Nothing wrong with any of these approaches. However, it is what happens when there is an industry wide supply issue that it can really hit the fan…onsite emergency supplies dry out, other suppliers don’t want to know, then your operational systems grind to a halt, critically you are unable to meet customer’s expectations. Any brand equity that has been built up between yourself and the customer will be quickly eaten into.

How can this scenario be mitigated against? For a start this type of problem cannot be allayed overnight. Or can it?

This is where relationships come into play. If you can build up an inter-company relationship with your main suppliers, you can achieve a competitive edge and become a preferred customer over your competitors. This is not related to revenue spent with them but a preferred customer on a different level, one who is liked and respected.

“an informal strategic alliance can give you a competitive edge”.

This type of status can be achieved through the use of ‘soft skills’ …getting to know your supplier on a human level, treating them as you would like to be treated, encouraging them to ‘buy into’ your brand so that you can elevate your business in their eyes to that elusive preferred customer status. I would term this as a loose supplier integration. The easiest way to achieve this is to view the supplier’s employees as colleagues and interact with them as such. Make conversation, humans love it, ask them about their weekend, how their day is going. It’s surprising how far this type of interaction will help you get what you want when it comes to the crunch and you really need it, and trust me that day will come at some point. An additional benefit is for you and your employees. You will all feel more positive from these types of interaction, especially in contrast to a typical supplier relationship which is transactional and can sometimes be fractious.

There are no hard and fast rules to tell you that you have reached “preferred customer” status. You’ll just know. You will have formed an informal strategic alliance, a build-up of brand equity in your supply chain that can be used in the future to give you an edge over your competitors. You’ll be surprised how this equity can miraculously propel your supplier to find some raw materials overnight, when you are up against it.
