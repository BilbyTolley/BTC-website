It has been widely mooted in the media that there may be a post Covid-19 pandemic economic spring. So how will this pan out for businesses around the world?

Sadly, many businesses have not survived the crisis, indeed the LSE calculate that up to 900,000 business are at risk of perishing due to the impact of the virus. This impact in itself causes some problems related to a post pandemic ‘spring’ in that the business landscape is no longer the same. There is much greater uncertainty in business circles, largely because of government-imposed lockdowns and their effects, which has been felt more severely in business areas such as hospitality and travel.

Knock-on effects to the supply chains to these crucial business areas have not been making the headlines, but nevertheless this crucial infrastructure will have been negatively impacted not only through loss of forward business but also from customers entering financial difficulty.

The businesses who were agile enough to identify new opportunities fared better, but entering new markets or doing things differently came at a cost through the introduction of new operating methods or more aggressive marketing. In some cases, old business relationships were lost and new ones built very quickly and it is heartening to see that some businesses were able to adapt very quickly to rapidly changing circumstances.

Looking beyond the end of government-imposed controls enabled by successful vaccine rollouts, where does this leave the business world?

In some ways the world will never be the same - adaptability has become the norm. Working from home (WFH), Zoom meetings. New words have been added to everyone’s daily vocabulary…furlough, facemask, social distancing and now everyone has some understanding of how a virus propagates and survives.

> ...are businesses prepared for a post-COVID Spring?

Businesses then, are at the beginning of another phase of adaptation to new social norms, new working practices and crucially, new opportunities. If we take a closer look at the WFH model, we can see that some businesses have benefited greatly such as call centres, banks and office-based employees. If WFH is continued for these types of business, inevitably this will lead to greater profit through reduced rent or mortgages. What about businesses where it is hands-on, for example production-based environments?

This is where adoption of new working methods and indeed new organisational cultures may need to occur for businesses to quickly adapt to new markets.

Is your business prepared to deal with the new normal? Can you quickly adapt your internal systems to take advantage of enforced or unforeseen changes for all input and output areas of your operational set up? How will your organisational culture be affected? Will employees expect or be entitled to WFH indefinitely? It is possible that the UK government may enshrine the right to WFH ‘by default’ in the near future according to recent reports, [www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9694403](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9694403).
