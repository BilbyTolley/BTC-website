+++
We’ve all been there. The days when you can’t be bothered, you drag yourself into work and go through the motions. It happens. These days are not a problem when viewed in the bigger picture – it’s entirely natural to feel this way sometimes.

The problem is when this becomes endemic within the workforce. Even a handful of key employees feeling like this can have a huge detrimental effect, not only on other employees but on internal systems and ultimately customer service. This type of situation can be even more damaging for small/medium enterprises, which are typically stretched and have little time to spend ensuring employee attitudes to the company are positive.

How can motivation be maintained for an SME with limited resources? Firstly, let’s look at what motivation is…

Leading academics have, over the years, come up with several definitions so I’m going to paraphrase into one definition which hopefully encapsulates them all…

“Motivation is why we do things”

Yep it’s that simple. Well, it is until you take into account that we are all different with regard to our wants and needs, ie the “why” part of the definition. This can be then broken down into extrinsic and intrinsic factors that affect a person’s motivational outlook. _Extrinsic_ includes employee performance reviews, monthly awards, pay, conditions, work environment etc (includes avoiding punishment!) and _intrinsic_ comes from within the person, the internal ‘desire’ to learn, grow, enjoy something and be fulfilled.

From a business perspective, it may look like you only have control over the extrinsic aspect affecting an employee, but this may be short sighted. An example is the training of employees. Once the training (extrinsic) is completed, the employee may now enjoy that task and therefore the motivation to do that task becomes intrinsic. In this example the _intrinsic_ motivation is influenced by the _extrinsic_ motivation and the business and employee both benefit – happy days!

With regard to company culture, sometimes the best way to increase motivation can be a very subtle change related to the way supervisory and management grades interact with employees when it comes to praise. Establishing a positive praise system can lead to a sea-change in the overall levels of motivation in a company as the positive praise feeds into an employee’s intrinsic motivations. This quick fix can rapidly change how your company is viewed from within and ultimately will lead to greater efficiency, higher quality work and increased retention of employees. Give it a try - it works!
