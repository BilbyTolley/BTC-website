The term “Industry 4.0” is becoming more mainstream, so what exactly is it? Industry 4.0 is the _fourth industrial revolution_ continuing a series of transformational periods of innovation that started with the first industrial revolution (around 1760) in which the advent of water and steam power enabled the move from hand to machine production. The first factories were inhabited by innovations such as Arkwright’s water frame and Hargreaves’ spinning jenny.

The subsequent incarnations aren’t as well-known but each of them embodied a great leap forward in human capability. Industrial Revolution No.2 is generally considered to have been about 100 years later when a surge of ground-breaking innovations took the world by storm, leading to standardisation and mass-production of everything from consumer goods to cars. Key innovations were Edison’s light bulb, Marconi’s radio and the Bessemer process to manufacture steel.

Fast forward to the 1980s and we saw the 3rd Industrial Revolution – computerisation and automation. Were you a devotee of the BBC Micro or the ZX Spectrum? It was one or the other and almost as polarising as mods against rockers. Floppy disks gave way to re-writable CDs and the internet became indispensable. Life would never be the same again. In factories, robots began to automate tasks on the production line.

So now we have the _fourth industrial revolution_, a.k.a. _Industry 4.0, which in essence_ is all about “intelligent” connected machines and their communication with each other as well as humans. In the home we are starting to see intelligent fridges that can remind you when you are running out of milk (or beer). Alexa and her friends are becoming ubiquitous and some people worry that their private conversations are being analysed by a computer somewhere. In manufacturing, interconnected sensors are generating huge volumes of data that are analysed by AI technologies such as Machine Learning. The results of this type of analysis allow significant improvements to manufacturing processes. Surprisingly, Siemens spend more on collecting and analysing data on the operation of their wind turbines than they spend manufacturing the turbines themselves!

Further examples of the interconnectedness of Industry 4.0 are in the clothing industry where technology allows the customer to be measured using their camera phone The data is transmitted directly to the factory where a garment is custom-made. In supply chain networks, as data sharing becomes the norm, supply chain integration and visibility will improve. COVID effects notwithstanding this can reduce working capital requirements significantly.

There have long been concerns that robots will be putting people out of work but that is not necessarily the case. What is more certain is the jobs that people do will change and people will need to re-skill and evolve as the machines evolve. In short we will need to adapt. Successful businesses are likely to be the ones that can perpetuate a symbiotic relationship between humans and machines, and managing company culture through this evolution is an important consideration.

Geographically, the North of England had a big part to play, with Lancashire being a textiles centre in revolution No.1 and Sheffield, the “steel city” being a major focus of No.2. The North remains vitally important in the fourth industrial revolution. Northern universities continue to churn out high-quality graduates and the Northern Powerhouse region is now home to a thriving technology scene.

At Bilby Tolley & Company our concern is that SMEs, who don’t have the technology budget of larger firms, may be left behind as their competitors adopt Industry 4.0 methods and technologies. But it doesn’t have to cost a fortune nor does it have to be built from scratch – many I4.0 technologies have been commoditised by the likes of Microsoft, Amazon and Google and are available at reasonable prices. Can you afford not to modernise?
